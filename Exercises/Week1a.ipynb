    "In this course you'll learn how to work with large amounts of real data and extract novel insights from complex systems. **If you aspire to become a Data Scientist down the road, this is the right course for you**. If you just want to learn more about working with Big Data (which is always useful knowledge in an increasingly data driven society), you have also come to the right place. And if you just came for the credits, I'm sure you'll have fun too (though I will make you work for them).\n",

We use this format because it aligns my goals with yours: I want you to come to class, be prepared and work hard when you are here. You want to minimize the amount of time you spend doing school stuff so you can enjoy your stay in Denmark. If you come to class prepared and manage to work your way through all the problems, you only have a bit of reading and copy/pasting to do outside of class.\n",

    "Each notebook contains (1) an overview of the things we'll go through, (2) a note about reading, which you are expected to have completed before attending each session, and (3) a section with exercises.  **To succeed in this course you simply start from the top** and follow the instructions."
