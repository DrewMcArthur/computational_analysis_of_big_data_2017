### Computational Analysis of Big Data

This is the GitHub page for the course [Computational Analysis for Big Data](https://disabroad.org/copenhagen/courses/computation-analyses-big-data/) offered by [DIS](https://disabroad.org/).

If you're a student of this course in the fall of 2017, then go ahead and:

1. Fire up a terminal/console on your computer.
2. Navigate to the directory in your computer where you keep your university course folders for this semester
3. Run `git clone https://github.com/ulfaslak/computational_analysis_of_big_data_2017`

Now you have all the course files on your computer. When I update the course material (and I do every now and then) you can get the newest version of all the files by running `git pull origin master` from inside the course folder. I recommend you get used to doing this before every class session, so that you don't solve outdated exercises.

**Important**: Do not edit the files that you pull from this Github repository. Because I update them every now and then, changes you make will potentially be overwritten and lost. Instead, if you want to edit them I recommend copying them out of the directory and editing the copies.
