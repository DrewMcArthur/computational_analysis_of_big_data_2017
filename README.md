### Computational Analysis of Big Data

This is the GitHub page for the course [Computational Analysis for Big Data](https://disabroad.org/copenhagen/courses/computation-analyses-big-data/) offered by [DIS](https://disabroad.org/).

If you're a student of this course in the fall of 2017, then go ahead and:

1. Fire up a terminal/console on your computer.
2. Navigate to the directory in your computer where you keep your university course folders for this semester
3. Run `git clone git@github.com:ulfaslak/computational_analysis_of_big_data_2017.git`

Now you have all the course files on your computer. When I update the course material (and I do every now and then) you can get the newest version of all the files by running `git pull origin master` from inside the course folder. I recommend you get used to doing this before every class session, so that you don't solve outdated exercises.

If you go to the [Wiki tab](https://github.com/ulfaslak/computational_analysis_of_big_data_2017/wiki), you will see that there's a lot of information. This is the same information that you can also find on Canvas, but I keep it here too for convenience sake. The pages contain *all* the information you need for this course, and I recommend you take 20-30 minutes to read through them.
